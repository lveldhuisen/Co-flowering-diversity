# Code for all ch 1 analyses, includes Schoener's Index, network analyses & phylogenetic analyses

The file titled "SchoenersIndex.R" contains the code for phenology and fitness Schoener's Index calculations. This file also contains the code for the Kruskal-Wallis test and figure in Supplemental Material Figure S1.

The file titled "network_analysis.R" contains code for the network analyses (modularity and null models), but not code for the network analysis figures (this was done in Gephi). 

The files titled "S&B_phylogeneticmetrics_bymodule" and "S&B_phylogeneticmetrics_bysite" contain the code for community phylogenetic metrics based on the Smith & Brown 2018 phylogeny. The "by_module" file contains code for MPD, MNTD and PD for beginning, middle and end of season flowering modules, and SES calculations. The "by_site" file contains code for the same metrics, but groups by elevational site and not module. 

The file "fitnessinfo_supplemental.R" contains all the fitness data and calculations for Supplemental Materials Table S1.

The file "figures.R" contains code for all individual figures. Final figure editing and putting all sites and years together was done in Adobe Illustrator.
