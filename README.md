# Code for all ch 1 analyses, includes Schoener's Index, network analyses & phylogenetic analyses

The file titled "SchoenersIndex.R" contains the code for phenology and fitness Schoener's Index calculations. This file also contains the code for the Kruskal-Wallis test and figure in Supplemental Material Figure S1.

The file titled "network_analysis.R" contains code for the network analyses (modularity and null models), but not code for the network analysis figures (this was done in Gephi). 

The files titled "S&B_phylogeneticmetrics_bymodule" and "S&B_phylogeneticmetrics_bysite" contain the code for community phylogenetic metrics based on the Smith & Brown 2018 phylogeny. The "by_module" file contains code for MPD, MNTD and PD for beginning, middle and end of season flowering modules, and SES calculations. The "by_site" file contains code for the same metrics, but groups by elevational site and not module. 

The file "fitnessinfo_supplemental.R" contains all the fitness data and calculations for Supplemental Materials Table S1.
