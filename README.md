    <sub> Figure 1: Figure shows the comparison of relative error versus number of points on $N \times N$ grid for three propagation distances $z = 100,500,1000$ m at discretization size $\Delta x = 10^{-3}$ . We find here the accuracy of the Sinc method is independent of propagation distance( $z$ ) whereas FFT based method's accuracy reduces with the propagation of distance. </sub>
